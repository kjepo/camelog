# Operating Manuals for Camelog

## Welcome to Camelog!

Welcome to Camelog, a genuine log house!

The aim of this manual is to simplify your vacation.
If this is your first time in Camelog you may want to sit down,
have some tea, and spend a few minutes glancing through these pages.

Here you will find a list of what we provide, how to operate
the appliances, and how to get in touch with the caretaker
if something is missing or not working.

We have also included some pointers on where to go for shopping, sightseeing, etc.

## If you need assistance

### Telephones

You will notice that the reception for cellphones is very weak around here.
The signal is slightly better on the deck outside.

The telephone in the kitchen accepts incoming calls to 01841-540764 but
outgoing calls are restricted to emergency calls and 800-calls.

Telephone cards that use 800-numbers can be purchased in most grocery stores.
(Make sure that the clerk understands that you're not asking for a *mobile*
phone card.)

### Power failure

In the event of a power failure, a torch under the staircase should
come on.  There should also be some candles and matches in one of
the kitchen dresser.

### Medical care

Dial 999 or 112 only in an emergency where there is danger to life
or a crime in progress.  This includes the Police, Fire Brigade,
Ambulance Service or Coastguard.  When asked for your adress, state
the following:
```
 Camelog, Rosehill
 Little Petherick
 Cornwall PL27 7QT
 Telephone: 01841-540764
