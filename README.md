# Welcome to Camelog!

Welcome to Camelog, a genuine log house!

The aim of this manual is to simplify your vacation.
If this is your first time in Camelog you may want to sit down,
have some tea, and spend a few minutes glancing through these pages.

Here you will find a list of what we provide, how to operate
the appliances, and how to get in touch with the caretaker
if something is missing or not working.

We have also included some pointers on where to go for shopping, sightseeing, etc.

# 1. If you need assistance

<a name="telephones"></a>
## Telephones

You will notice that the reception for cellphones is very weak around here.
The signal is slightly better on the deck outside.

The telephone in the kitchen accepts incoming calls to 01841-540764 but
outgoing calls are restricted to emergency calls and 800-calls.

Telephone cards that use 800-numbers can be purchased in most grocery stores.
(Make sure that the clerk understands that you're not asking for a *mobile*
phone card.)

<a name="powerfailure"></a>
## Power failure

In the event of a power failure, a torch under the staircase should
come on.  There should also be some candles and matches in one of
the kitchen dresser.

<a name="medicalcare"></a>
## Medical care

Dial `999` or `112` only in an emergency where there is danger to life

<a name="caretaker"></a>
## Your caretaker

There should be leaflets in the house with contact information.

<a name="overview"></a>
# 2. Overview of the house

The next few sections will describe where to find things
(such as the ironing board) and give simple instructions on how to
perform *typical jobs*, like washing some clothes.
We're assuming that you have used similar appliances
before and just need to know what buttons to push to get the job done.

You will find manuals for some of the appliances at the end of this 
booklet in case you need to do something out of the ordinary,
or simply forgot to bring a book for your holiday.

Let us now start with the most button-populated part of the house, 
namely the kitchen.

<a name="kitchen"></a>
## Kitchen

As a general rule of thumb, if some of the appliances don't seem to
work, please make sure that the socket switch is on.  For instance,
the hob/oven, washing machine, washer/dryer and the extractor all
have a main switch on the wall -- these are all labelled.

<a name="dishwasher"></a>
### Dishwasher

The caretaker provides you with the first tablets needed to run the dishwasher.

- Scrape or rinse off excess food and put the crockery in the machine.
- Put a tablet in the compartment and slide the lid over it until it 
  snaps on, as shown in the picture.
- Turn on the machine by pressing the button appearing in the
 lower left corner in the picture.
- Shut the door and the dishwasher will start.
- After about 2.5 hours the machine will beep five times, 
 signalling it is done.  (It will beep again
 after another ten minutes, and then again, and then one more time,
 but will stay quiet after that.)
- Open the door, turn off the power and let the crockery dry.

Please do not wash wood, for instance knives with the wooden handles.

<a name="washerdryer"></a>
### Washer/dryer

The following is just a simplified series of steps that
tells you how to do a typical 40ยบ wash of cotton clothes.
For more elaborate programmes, please refer to the more detailed manual
for the washing machine in this file.

If the machine doesn't respond, check first that the power switch is on,
located on the wall above the worktop surface.

- Ensure that the machine isn't turned on (no red lights on).
- Open the door by pulling the catch outward.

- If you have a detergent tablet (a few should be supplied), 
  put it in a bag with the rest of the clothes.
- If you are using powder detergent, pull out the tray and fill up the 
  middle compartment.  The more detailed manual tells you
  what detergents should be used and what the various compartments are for.

- Turn the rightmost dial *clockwise* to `D`.
  You may have to pop the dial out by first pushing on it.
- Start the machine by pressing the ON/OFF button which is the 
  rightmost of the rectangular buttons.  The mains-on light
  comes on and the machine starts operating.

The program takes roughly two hours.  The washing cycle stops 
when the right dial is between `G` and `F`.

The door is controlled by a safety device which releases 2 minutes 
after the end of the programme. 

- Switch the machine off by depressing the ON/OFF button again, and
  the mains-on light goes out.

<a name="hoboven"></a>
### Hob and oven

The induction hob works just like a regular electrical hob,
but pots and pans must be made of steel or cast iron.
If you have brought your own, pans made of aluminium, brass and copper
won't work unless they're specially designed for induction and have a
ferrous base. Stainless steel will only work if its base is made of magnetic
grade steel.

The oven has built-in timers that can either turn the oven on
or off, or simply serve as a reminder alarm.  The manual for
the oven explains it all quite well.

For the typical heat-up-the-pizza job, turn the dial
to `...` and set the temperature.  The red light
goes off when the oven has reached that temperature.
If you want to be reminded when your pizza is ready, 
set the timer by first pressing the bell button and then use
the `+` and `-` buttons to set the number of 
minutes.  The oven will beep after that many minutes, but it won't
turn itself off.

<a name="microwave"></a>
### Microwave

To heat up food you usually follow these steps.

- Put your food container on the glass plate and close the door.
 Use the plastic cover to prevent food from splashing the inside
 of the microwave.

- Set the timer using the `+` and `-` buttons.
- Set the desired power by repeatedly pressing the `/` button.
For a typical frozen dinner you would use 750 W. 
- Press `Jet Start`.

If you need to experiment with the microwave buttons, please put a mug
of water inside the microwave to avoid running it empty.

You can always open the door while the microwave is running to stop it.
Closing the door and pressing `Jet Start` will continue with the program.

fixme: check buttons

<a name="livingarea"></a>
## Living Area

<a name="skytv"></a>
### Sky TV

There are two remote controls, one for the TV and one for the Sky box.

Since there is no aerial, you'll be using Sky for watching the regular channels.
You may already be familiar with Sky's remote control, but if you're not
we would suggest hitting the `tv guide` button followed by `1`
and then walk through the various channels using the up and down arrow keys.  
When you have found a channel that looks interesting, simply 
press `select`.
If at any time you get lost in the Sky menus and just want to go back to
viewing one of the channels, press the `Sky` button.

There's also a DVD player with some films in the drawer underneath the TV.

<a name="stereo"></a>
### Stereo
The stereo can play off your phone if you connect with a USB-cable.

Radio reception is (you guessed it) weak around here.  We recommend
listening to the radio via one of the Sky channels.  Select 
`tv guide` and then choose the category for Radio and Music to
see what is available.
